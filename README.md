- Overall the temperatures are very similar between the 2 months with the average temperature in June being 74.9 degrees, while the average temperature in December is 71.04 degrees.
- December features a greater desparity between its high and low temperatures as the temperatures can get as high as 83 degrees and as low as 56 degrees. June's high low and temperatures are between 85 degrees and 64 degrees.
- December also features a less consistent temperature than June as reflected in the standard deviation. December features a 3.74 standard deviation, while June's standard deviation is 3.25.

## Summary
Overall it looks like the surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable year-round due to the fairly consistent warm temperatures in both June and December. However it would be a good idea to look at the precipitation for both months, because not many people want to eat ice cream on a rainy day!

From analyzing the precipitation for both June and December, we can determine that there is not much rainfall in either month on average. There's a greater chance of rain in December, but again it isn't very much only coming to about .21 inches of rain for the month, while June comes in at about .13 inches. So it looks like nice weather year around!
